slow spread for ai?

no bardbs early?+no attacks from them+no cities?
units pass near barbs and they wont attack at all....
barn wont wdvance in tech units due to resources? they come with warriors and archer.
for sure - 0 attacks from barbs ...

ai behaviour:
togogwa built 2 cities near 4 deserts when there was green near him....
he prefered close borders over better locations??
this caused his research to be very low....
no walls on japans cities...

tech trade? wierd - how can i do so before writing?

wierd thing - when build - there is a double city build pop up  - nothing importent though
turn insights:
turn 137 
only warriors are spawned.
turn 142
im weaker than japan - yet no ai trade or contact at all and no apparent war on sight.
turn 179
some barbs spearmans, low atatcks.
ai still not expanding much - 
never made diplomacy contact
no war.
turn 198
no barb cities
japan cities - some are with 1 defending unit.
turn 225
japan cities are low, barely developed almosst un defended.
maybe he dont have money?

costs:
units + buildings costs so so - maybe slow city growth
also too much gems 
low horse copper and iron
tech acctually could be a bit cheeper.

doto:
make religion limit optional + unique religion + forbidden?
add option to play without spies?
amon ra tech icon is ping !!
