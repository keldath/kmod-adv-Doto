Outstanding issues:

-  Issues with "enemy spotted near"?
-  Espionage slider at 100% for human player?
-  Adjust where new capital is placed after loss?
-  Very first turn players skipped if shuffle teams selected
-  Diplomacy text to clarify when AI declines trades because of relations with teammates, vassals
-  Tech score is summed in team score though tech is shared, producing bias towards teams with more players
-  Path planning issues for groups with some commandos
-  What else should scale by game speed?  Diplomacy has biggest effect, but may be too big for here ...

Version 1.00 fixes:

1)  CvUnitAI::AI_paradrop - fixed bug with valuation of terrain bonuses causing paradrops to avoid bonuses in some circumstances when intention is clearly to encourage landing on bonuses and pillaging
2)  CvUnitAI::AI_settleMove - fixed bug when settler cannot reach a city site in an area (blocked by mountains, other player).  Caused settler to wait infinitely in city instead of loading into transport.
3)  CvTeamAI::AI_doWar - use bFinancesProLimitedWar for limited war calc instead of max war version
4)  CvPlayerAI::AI_calculateUnitAIViability - Fixed incorrect integer usage which caused function return to be meaningless, blocked AI logic for building privateers
5)  CvPlayerAI::AI_isFinancialTrouble, CvCityAI::AI_updateBestBuild, and CvPlayerAI::AI_getMinFoundValue - Fixed bug in calculating expenses when AI has negative gold per turn
6)  CvPlayerAI::AI_getTotalFloatingDefendersNeeded - Fixed poor decision by AI if it has captured one or two cities on someone else's continent, it would minimally defend its new cities
7)  CvPlayerAI::AI_getStrategyHash - Fixed incorrect counting of destroyers as mobile anti-air
8)  CvPlayerAI::AI_doDiplo - Fixed issue where team is sneak attack ready but hasn't declared war, AI would still demand tribute. If other team accepted, it blocked war declaration for 10 turns but AI still launched invasion and was then bounced when it could eventually declare.
9)  CvPlayerAI::AI_bestPlotEspionage - relevant weights are 0, +- 50, +- 100, so comparison for Agg AI should be < 51 instead of < 50
10)  CvPlayerAI::AI_commerceWeight - Governors now do smarter things when human player sets culture slider to 100%
11)  isPotentialEnemy in CvGameCoreUtils - Fixed bug leading to AI launching invasions when unable to declare war, troops eventually got bounced when war was declared

15)  CvCityAI::AI_neededDefenders - Improved efficiency and minor tweaks
16)  CvPlayerAI::AI_isFinancialTrouble, CvCityAI::AI_updateBestBuild, and CvPlayerAI::AI_getMinFoundValue - Fixed bug where spending gpt for resources reduced calculation of expenses (thanks DanF5771)
17)  CvPlayerAI::AI_conquerCity - Fixed bug where cityAcquiredAndKept event reported wrong player in some circumstances (thanks Maniac)
18)  CvPlayerAI::AI_unitValue - Fixed potential crash bug in looking up AI_unitValue for UNITAI_MISSIONARY units without passing a valid CvArea*
19)  CvUnit::isIntruding - Kept 3.17 unofficial patch feature that vassal spies are never caught in master's territory
20)  CvUnit::collateralCombat - Kept 3.17 unofficial patch feature which allows mods to enables barrage promotions for collateral damage units
21)  CvUnitAI::AI_assaultSeaMove - Fixed bug where unit type was used when unit AI type was intended
22)  CvUnit::canMoveInto - Capturing an undefended city is now considered an attack action, like capturing a worker.  Mainly affects paratroopers, who now cannot capture undefended cities right after paradrop.  Previously, paratroopers could capture undefended cities but not cities with only a worder or ship in them. (Change modified in later versions)
23)  CvTeam::shareCounters - Fixed bug in permanent alliances when No Tech Brokering is turned on, where a civ would often become unable to trade a tech they had researched after entering a permanent alliance.
24)  CvNetDoCommand::Execute - Fixed bug causing "Upgrade All" action to sometimes only do a fraction of the available units.
25)  CvPlayerAI::AI_unitValue - Stealth boats do not make good escorts since they often don't defend, so AI is now very unlikely to use them as escorts for transports.
26)  CIV4UnitInfos.xml - Removed UNITAI_ESCORT_SEA from Stealth Destroyer (stealth doesn't defend first, so not a good escort).  Set iPower weighting for Missile Cruiser to much more appropriate 42 from 14 (iPower ratings for boats were increased by Firaxis a while back, but they missed this one).
27)  CvCityAI::AI_yieldValue - Fixed issue causing city governor and AI to heavily weight food when building gold or any other form of commerce.  Produced unexpected and poor results for human player, did not help AI either.
28)  CvCity::setCultureLevel - Removed behavior where a city building culture would cancel order when reaching next level. Completely unnecessary for AI, human player is unlikely to be expecting this. Also appears to cause a bug with extra overflow production. (Change modified in later versions)
29)  CIV4UnitClassInfos.xml - Fixed description entry for ship of the line (thanks ripple01)
30)  CIV4ArtDefines_Unit.xml - Fixed many discrepancies in TrainSound between unique and non-unique units (thanks ripple01)
31)  CvRandomEventInterface.py - Fixed function name from getHelpThGoths1 to getHelpTheGoths1 (thanks Chrill)
32)  CvMapGeneratorUtil.py - Fixed function getLatitudeAtPlot in both FeatureGenerator and TerrainGenerator so that it properly returns 1.0 for both north and south poles and correctly locates equator (thanks Temudjin)
33)  CvPlot::getLatitude - Fixed so that it properly returns highest latitude value for both north and south poles and correctly locates equator, improved integer rounding errors which caused slight skew in terrain types between northern and southern hemisphere (thanks Temudjin)
34)  CvDLLWidgetData::parseFlagHelp - Added UP version info to help popup when mousing over big flag in bottom right.
