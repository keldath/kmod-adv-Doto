Doto Doc\dotoDebug-use under bts.ini and CvGameCoreDLL\project\CvGameCoreDLL.vcxproj.user are intended for debugging, but won't work out of the box. It's probably easier to get rid of these and, if and when you do use the debugger, instead use the following procedure (copy-pasted from the yet unreleased AdvCiv 0.96 manual and replaced "AdvCiv" with "Fractured States"):

To attach the VS debugger, I recommend creating a copy of My Games\Beyond the Sword\CivilizationIV.ini, e.g. named FracturedStatesDebug.ini. It's easiest to place it in the same directory as Civ4BeyondSword.exe. In the copy, set FullScreen = 0 and Mod = Mods\Fractured States. You may also want to reduce ScreenHeight a little (rationale) and make some other debug-friendly settings: CheatCode = chipotle, LoggingEnabled = 1, AutoSaveInterval = 1. Then, select the "Debug" configuration in VS 2010 and under "Configuration Properties", "Debugging" enter Civ4BeyondSword.exe with its full path(!) into the "Command" field and ini=FracturedStatesDebug.ini into "Command Arguments". (VS will write that information into CvGameCoreDLL\Project\CvGameCoreDLL.vcxproj.user; that file can also be edited directly.) You can then "Start Debugging" via the "Debug" menu.

If you want to change or remove the mod version information that gets shown when hovering over the large flag button, then CvDLLWidgetData:: parseFlagHelp is the place to do it.
