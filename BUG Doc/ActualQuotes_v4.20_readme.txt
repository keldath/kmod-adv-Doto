	This mod replaces the original leader-specific diplomacy text 
	with text based on attributed quotes -- some famous, and some 
	not so famous.


	New to Beyond the Sword:

*All Hammurabi's quotes have been adapted from the "Code of Hammurabi", a law text 
commissioned by him and presented as his own words.

*Zara Yaqob's quotes are taken from "The Chronicle of the Emperor Zara Yaqob".

*Suryavarman's one "quote" is an adaptation of the oath of allegiance required to be 
taken by all Suryavarman's officials.

*Darius' few quotes are taken from the Bible.

*All Gilgamesh's quotes are lifted from the "Epic of Gilgamesh". Many are shortened, 
and some have been combined with other parts of the text in order to make better sense 
in our context.

*Boudicca's quotes are taken entirely from various parts of Tacitus' rendition of 
Boudicca's final battle cry.

*There are 617 glyphs in Pacal's tomb. Only some of these have been deciphered, and 
Pacal's "quote" is taken from the current interpretation of the meaning of the 
so-called "shield glyph".

	New to Warlords:

*Mehmed II's single "quote" is an invention (by me) based on the alleged promise the
 sultan made to his men during the siege of Constantinople, that they could have "the 
women and the boys of the city".

*Most of Ragnar Lodbrok's quotes are taken from the saga "The Last of the Volsungs" as 
translated by Donald Mackenzie. These quotes are thus rhyming verse. Ideally, quotes 
would have been taken from the possibly more accurate "The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok and 
his sons" ("Ragnars saga loðbrókar ok sona hans"), however I have been unable to find 
a translation of this text.

*There exist no quotes attributed to Shaka Zulu. Instead, I have used snippets from 
a traditional Zulu "praise song" that has Shaka as its subject.

*The quotes for Ramesses II have been taken from a commemorative stela of the Ramesside 
family located at Tanis; the stela commemorating the marriage between Ramesses II and 
the daughter of the chief of Kheta; and from the peace treaty between Ramesses II and 
the Hittite king Hattusili III.

*Wang Kon does not currently have any new text, as I have been unable to find even a 
whisper of a quote attributed to him.

	Original vanilla content:

*Quotes for Mansa Musa are taken from Al-Umari's description of Musa's visit to Cairo 
in 1324.

*Quotes for Montezuma have been taken in part from the various Codices in which Aztec 
eyewitness accounts are recorded, and in part from Cortez's own account of his meeting 
with Montezuma.

*Note that the one quote used for Huayna Capac was in fact uttered by his son, Inca 
Atahuallpa, to Fray Wincente Valverde.

*Most quotes for Asoka are taken from "The Edicts of KingAshoka", a collection of 
proclamations concerned mainly with social reform. They were apparently written in 
Asoka's own words.

*Most quotes for Qin Shi Huang are taken from a stoneinscription on Mount Langya set 
up to praise Qin and make his will clear. As few direct quotes exist, this was the 
second best thing.

*The few quotes used for Cyrus are Biblical, as no othersource claiming to have his 
exact words exist. The Bible quotes are probably mostly fiction too, but in this context
better than nothing.

*Quotes for Hatshepsut are taken from various Egyptian inscriptions made during her reign.


	*All other leaders' quotes are from various sources around 
	the internet, and all are well known, even if some may be 
	apocryphal.
