hi all,

this mod, 
is a modmod to Advanced Civ mod by f1rpo.
the mod is merged with parts from my flag mod - dawn of the overlords.

i have decided to  simplfy the mod and give it a reboot , based of the great advc mod.

this is the most stable version of a mod i have ever had, free of ctd's and bugs (as far as the debugger popped).


many thanks to f1rpo that helped massivly with this merge happening and for his best AI code since kmod.
to all that made modding possible and varied on civ fanatics.

enjoy,
keldath.
