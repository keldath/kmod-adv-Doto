	<!-- [advc.104x] This file used to be called BBAI_AI_Variables_
		 GlobalDefines.xml; now also contains UWAI parameters.

		 UWAI breaks down the computation of AI war utility into a sum of
		 27 "aspects", most of which are either in favor of war (added to the
		 total war utility) or against war (subtracted). There are a few mixed
		 aspects that could either increase or decrease war utility.
		 Each aspect corresponds to one particular motivation for or against war.
		 Through this file, a weight is assigned to each aspect. This weight is
		 interpreted as a percentage by which the aspect utility is multiplied.
		 The default (recommended) weights are all 100. This doesn't imply though
		 that all aspects contribute equally by default; the weights are only a
		 final adjustment to the (hardcoded) formulas.
		 A weight of e.g. 50 halves the default impact of an aspect, 200
		 doubles it. 0 means that the aspect is entirely disregarded. A
		 negative weight (not recommended) turns a pro-war aspect into an
		 anti-war aspect or vice versa.
		 In the descriptions below, "we" refers to the AI civ that is
		 considering war. -->
