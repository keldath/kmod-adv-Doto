		<English>[COLOR_MAGENTA]A Brief Mod History [COLOR_REVERT]
Doto 2019 is a result of 12 years of thousands of civ4 hours that ive put over ther years.
The mod has gone through many many changes and versions.
[NEWLINE]
My modding agenda is to give amod that enriches gameplay while conserving mod size in every aspect, 
for memory issues, as well as multiplayer friendly.
its about enjoy a rich mod in a small package.
This current version is named Doto Remastred and it is a ModMod for the magnificant F1rpo 
mod - [COLOR_MAGENTA]Advanced Civ (v095)[COLOR_REVERT].
you can see the mod readme and my civfanatics thread for information.

Thanks to all the Modders over the years and f1rpo for the increddible support
