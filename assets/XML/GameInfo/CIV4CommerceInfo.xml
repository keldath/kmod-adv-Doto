iInitialPercent	 The percent value given to a commerce type when the game starts (default is 100 for research, 0 for all others).
iInitialHappiness	 Sets the happiness received by this commerce type. Each n% to that commerce type provides a happy face (default is 10 for culture, 0 for all others).
iAIWeightPercent	 Sets the importance of this commerce type for the AI (default is 100 for gold, 125 for research, and 25 for culture and espionage).
