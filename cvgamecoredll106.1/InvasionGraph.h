/* advc.104: New class. The invasion graph says who tries to invade whom.
   It's an analysis from the perspective of one civ ("we", the owner of
   the associated MilitaryAnalyst) planning war (UWAI::Team::doWar).
   There's a node in the graph for each civ that is presently at war or
   is soon going to be. Projected wars are based on the knowledge of "we",
   i.e. our war plans in preparation and under consideration, and wars linked
   to these war plans.
   NB: This class does not _decide_ who targets whom. That happens in CvPlayerAI.
   The invasion graph is a prediction on which our team bases its decisions
   on war and peace.
   The graph can also run a simulation of who might conquer which cities.
   Cf. simulate(int).
   Fixme: This class does too much and has too many LoC. If everything triggered
   by simulate(int) could be encapsulated in a new class (and file), that would
   be best. Else, at least the step function should be moved into SimulationStep,
   and SimulationStep into a new file. */
