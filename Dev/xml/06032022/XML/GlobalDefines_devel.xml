		 /My Games/Beyond The Sword/Logs every REPORT_INTERVAL turns.
		 For multiplayer games, the MessageLog (CivilizationIV.ini) needs to be
		 enabled in addition.
		 It's not necessary to compile a debug DLL in order to see the reports.
		 Each report records the war planning of all AI civs during a single 
		 turn. Set to 0 or less to disable logging. -->
