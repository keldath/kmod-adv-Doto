			 in one place. -->
		<element type="CivilizationType"/>
		<!-- Latitude and longitude of the civ's capital, given as degrees
			 at times 10 precision. I.e. _not_ given as minutes. -->
		<!-- Can take any values between -900 and +900.
			 Negative sign for southern hemisphere. -->

			 which are easy to look up on Wikipedia (though the minutes stated
			 there will have to be converted to tenths of degrees through
			 multiplication by 5/3). -->
		<!-- Annual, in millimeters. I've mostly tried to find the present-day
			 precipitation average of the modern country or countries
			 corresponding to the civ.
			 This translates into a preference for terrain and feature types.
			 The ids of those types are obtained from the Global Warming
			 definitions in GlobalDefinesAlt.xml. -->
		<element type="iPrecipitation" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- A percentage expressing how much the climate varies across the
			 (core) territory of the civilization. Again, this results in a
			 bias for terrain and feature types, so not all kinds of variations
			 should be equally reflected by the percentage. Large civs should
			 tend to have higher variation values (because players will
			 associate them with diverse biomes), but the degree of variation
			 within smaller subareas should also matter. For example, Western
			 Russia does not have much variation, whereas Korea is quite varied
			 for a small country. -->
		<element type="iClimateVariation" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- Percentage expressing how maritime the civ is. The game -mostly-
			 aims at that ratio of sea tiles (or land tiles on a different
			 landmass than the starting tiles) among the tiles surrounding the
			 starting tile. To choose the values, I've looked at the
			 approximate ratios on Earth within a 550 km radius around the
			 capitals (that surface area, conveniently, covers about 1 mio.
			 square kilometers), then made adjustments based on the capitals'
			 distance from the coast, length of the coastline and the civs'
			 naval histories. -->
		<element type="iOceanity" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- Percentage expressing the importance of having a major river
			 (as in: one of the world's biggest or most prominent river systems)
			 near the civ's starting tile. 0 means that it doesn't matter
			 whether there's a major river. A negative percentage discourages
			 starts near major rivers. The default value is -25. (Civs not
			 strongly associated with a river should, ideally, have only
			 minor rivers near their starting plots.) -->
		<element type="iMajorRiverWeight" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- Highest elevation in meters that is within the historical
			 territory of the civ and not too far away from its core.
			 Translates into an affinity for Peaks.
			 Using prominence, or the highest elevation minus the average of
			 the civ's whole (core) territory, would be slightly more helpful,
			 but it really doesn't make much of a difference for the civs that
			 we have, and maximal elevation is easy to research. (I've mainly
			 used a table of extreme elevations per country on Wikipedia.) -->
		<element type="iMaxElevation" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- Percentage of the civ's core area that has a mountainous relief.
			 (This is a matter of gradients, not absolute elevation. E.g. an
			 altiplano is not considered mountainous in this context.)
			 Translates into an affinity for hills and peaks.
			 (I use crude approximations based on some world map showing that
			 info on a per-country basis.) -->
		<element type="iMountainousArea" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- In units of 1000 square kilometer. Hard to say which borders to
			 use. Results in a (slight) bias for or against starting tiles
			 with (somewhat) more space for expansion than the average.
			 The specific numbers don't matter much, just the order of
			 magnitude. For empires, the largest extent can vastly exceed
			 the pre-imperial or core area. I've been picking modest sizes
			 in these cases, also taking into account whether the conquered
			 peoples are represented in the game as civs. In any case, a civ
			 should have to do some actual conquering to become a veritable
			 empire. However, small sizes, say, less than 250 thousand square
			 kilometers, should be reserved for civs that are only thought of
			 as small, including colonial empires like Portugal. -->
		<element type="iTotalArea" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- Target ratio of the horizontal to the vertical dimension of the
			 civ's space for expansion, as a percentage. E.g. 150 means that
			 the civ should have 50% more space for expansion in west-east
			 direction than in north-south direction. Should not necessarily
			 be used for civs that expanded into a particular direction as
			 empires (e.g. Persia) because having space in that direction
			 can mean that they'll conquer neighboring civs in just the
			 perpendicular (counter-historical) direction. I'm also never
			 setting a preference for civs with a small area because their
			 shape didn't matter much historically. For large civs, like
			 Egypt, the shape mattered more as it caused them to span multiple
			 climate zones. -->
		<element type="iHStretch" minOccurs="0"/>
		<!-- To make preferences for bonus resources easier to specify.
			 Use ARTSTYLE_... strings here to avoid having to define a new
			 global type for the regions. Using the artstyles already assigned
			 for CivilizationInfos wouldn't (always) work since those are based
			 on culture, not geography. Moreover, a mod might add and assign
			 new artstyles (but I doubt that it would eliminate any of the
			 existing ones). -->
