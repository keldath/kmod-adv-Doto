		<English>[TAB]The Kizil Kule (Red Tower) is a historical tower in the Turkish city of Alanya. The building is considered to be the symbol of the city, and is even used on the city's flag.[PARAGRAPH:2]Construction of the building began in the early reign of the Anatolian Seljuq Sultan Ala ad-Din Kay Qubadh I and was completed in 1226. The sultan brought the accomplished architect Ebu Ali Reha from Aleppo, Syria to Alanya to complete the building. The octagonal red brick tower protects the Tersane (shipyard) which dates from 1221.[PARAGRAPH:2]The name derives from the more red color brick he used in its construction. The building itself is 33 m high and 12.5 m wide. It remains one of the finest examples of medieval military architecture, and is the best preserved Seljuk building in the city. Like many buildings in the city, the Tower flies a Turkish Flag from its crenelations.</English>
