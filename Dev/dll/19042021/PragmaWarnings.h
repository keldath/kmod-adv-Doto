/*	advc.make: Header for custom compiler warnings through pragma.
	(I'm using a shorthand that allows subtracting 4000 from warning numbers;
	e.g. 251 corresponds to c4251 in compiler output and documentation.)
	BtS had disabled number 251 (redundantly in several headers),
	100 (through CvDLLEntityIFaceBase.h), 127 (through CvInfo.h).
	I'm not sure if it was necessary to disable those explicitly in BtS,
	but I do need to disable them now b/c of the /W4 compiler option.
	I'm not disabling number 530 ("C++ exception handler used,
	but unwind semantics are not enabled") b/c I'm not getting any such
	warnings. BtS had disabled that one through the PCH. */

/*	These should remain enabled even if the global level is dialed back down to 3.
	But I'm not sure how disable them in the std headers etc.
	May need to put them into a separate header for that, to be included in the PCH
	after loading the non-conforming headers. */
