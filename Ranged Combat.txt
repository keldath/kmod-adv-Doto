Ranged combat system by keldath.

based on VIP - Vincentz original ranged strike code.

affects 
1.  land or sea units.
2. units with air range >0 + air combat > 0 

mission types and definitions:
1. Bombard - Normal vanilla bombard
- will have random damage factor.

2. ranged strike 
-will have random damage factor
-units cannot bombard a city if its has city/building defence
-if a unit has ignore city/building defence - it will be able to range attack - but without collateral damage.

both missions will end movement.
cannot commit an attack on an invalid tile that does now meet the conditions above.


Air strike and bombard:
will now have random damage factor.

fix - left from behind - seems if a unit is damaged - it picks it from the stack and not the strongest
todo -  optional components with game options.
           option for a ranged attack to first reduce city defense only than attack units (original vip design)
           somehow make the bombard mission to be ranged , same as air bombard.
wish - use air strike and air bombard for land / sea units - optimal implementation for ai, existing mechanism.
