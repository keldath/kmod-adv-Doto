[advc.009]
Contains only settings for the mod components
* Advanced Unit Naming and
* Customizable Domestic Advisor
(both disabled by default through the BUG menu).
The folder has to have the same name as the BUG settings folder under /My Games/, which is set to SETTINGS_FOLDER = "Settings" in BugPath.py.

For configuring other BUG options, the in-game menu should be used; most of the defaults are set in /Assets/Config. The /Assets/XML root folder contains global settings for BUG, BBAI, K-Mod and AdvCiv.
