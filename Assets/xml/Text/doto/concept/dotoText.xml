siege land units will be able to inflict one time damage without the risk of being hit back by the defender.
the damage will be a percentage up to the combat limit (each unit has one).

if the defender is also a siege unit, it will attack back e.g. -> retaliate.
AI code was added , seems that ai use it well.
this is based off VIP mod and inspired by civ4 Reimagined.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]City States[\BOLD][NEWLINE]
Unique to Doto, City states are similar to CIVV+.
the cities will abide to several key rules. a player can have special unique trade agreement with each city to receive unique city perks along with a unique resource.
City states can be tweaked and changed in the GlobalDefinesAlt.xml at the bottom of it.
there are explanations per parameter.

- city states will be randomly spawned at turn 1 (only Ancient era).
- cannot grow beyond culture defined limit (parameter).
- cannot grow under defined culture limit (parameter).
- i conjured method to color the inner culture borders to distinct cs area controlled.
- new free trade agreement with CS -> will provide both the CS and the trading civ a Unique Bonus commerce (displayed in the cs Trait info).
- cs cannot build wonders.

- ai will always raze cs and vice versa (haven't done code for human player , yet).
- new population system - cities beyond parameter defined size will begin getting special specialists named civilians instead of population.
dynamically - there are 3 types, 1 per yield that is given to the city according to its lowest yield output.
these consume food.
there are several parameters - can be turned off as a game option in the GlobalDefinesAlt.xml.

- cs build units without Bonus Prereq! (i think i made it also a parameter).

- cs scoring is based off of population and land -> with power ups to compensate for one city....
- cannot build settlers....
- have a unique resource to trade with other civs - provide 1 health or happy (2 per city state)
- amount of cs is adjustable according to world size.

Some improvements cannot be built near each other.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Cultural Golden Age[\BOLD][NEWLINE]
after a certain threshold , from Culture, a golden Age will be triggered.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Wonder Limit (along with Wonder build 1:1 obsoleet)[\BOLD][NEWLINE]
each city can build wonders limited by its culture size.
if combined with wonder obsolete game options -> if a city has an obsolete wonder which is included in the wonder count,
it will ignore it and open a new wonder slot -> meaning for example culture limit is 5, city has 5 wonders which 1 is obsolete -> the option will allow the construction of the 6th
wonder in that case.
