		<English>[H1]Culture Control[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]This mod gives Tile Improvements the ablitity to emit Culture Borders, similar to Cities. The range that Culture Borders expand from the Improvement is set in a new CIV4ImprovementInfos.xml tag. There is no code limit to this range, but exceptionally high values may cause lag when Improvements are built. However, no normal value should cause any lag at all.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]If an Improvement Spreads Culture Control then the name of its owning Civilization will be displayed before the Improvement's Description on the Main Interface's Flying Help Text when you hover the Cursor over the Improvement's Plot..[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Improvements also have a Strength Value to their Culture Control. When an Improvement is placed, its Strength is added to each Tile in Range for the placing Player. When the game decides which Player's Border to place on the Tile, the Player with the highest Culture Control Strength will be choosen. If two or more Players tie for the highest Culture Control Strength, then no Player's Border will be placed on the Tile. The Percent of Culture Control for each Player with some Culture Control Strength will be displayed in the Flying Help Text when you hover the Cursor over a Tile.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]If you have Cheat Level enabled, then in Single Player games, you can hold the SHIFT key and various information about a Plot's Culture Control States will be displayed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are a few simple rules to how Improvement's Culture Control applies its Culture Borders.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rule 1: Cities Rule the Land[NEWLINE]A City's Culture Borders will always override any Improvement's Culture Border.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rule 1.5: There Are Always Exceptions[NEWLINE]The one exception to Rule 1. The Tile an Improvement is on will always keep its Culture Border until it is Pillaged by a Unit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rule 2: The More the Merrier[NEWLINE]The more Improvements with a Tile within their Range, the more Culture Control you will have on that Tile. The Player with the Highest Culture Control of a Tile will get their Culure Border around it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rule 2.5: Everyone Losses a Tie[NEWLINE]If two or more Players tie for the Highest Culture Control of a Tile then no Border at all will be applied to that Tile. If you don't control it more then everyone else, then you don't really control it, do you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rule 3: Borders Not Required[NEWLINE]If you don't like Improvements emiting Cutlture Borders, but you still would like Improvements to belong to the Civilization that builds them, you can set the CIV4ImprovementInfos.xml tag bSpreadCultureControl to 1 and iCultureBorderRange to -1. This will cause Improvements to be displayed as “Aztec Town”, “Sumarian Fort”,  “American Workshop”, etc, but will not add any Culture Border on or around them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rule 4: Fat Crosses for Everyone[NEWLINE]If an Improvement has an iCultureBorderRange of 2 or more, then its Culture Border will not be square. Instead it will be a Fat Cross similar to the larger levels of a City's Culture Border. Basicly, the 4 corner Tiles will not get Culture Border.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rule 4.5: Exceptions Make the Rule[NEWLINE]An Improvement with an iCultureBorderRange of 1 will be square and include the 8 Tiles around the Improvement's Tile. This also is similar to City Culture Border expansion.</English>
