		<English>[TAB]Telecommunications covers a wide range of technologies first developed in the 19th century.  Although civilizations had found ways to communicate over long distances for thousands of years, the first major development in telecommunications came with the electric telegraph in the 1830s.  This allowed text messages to be sent over long distances.  During the American Civil War, the telegraph along with the railroad redefined the nature of war in the coming century.  In the 1870s, the fist telephones were invented which allowed people to speak to each other verbally over long distances, which sure beat the hell out of the age old method of tin cans connected with a string.  Since then, many developments have been made to make telecommunications faster and more reliable, and these early forms of telecommunications helped give rise to the internet and mobile telephone technology with the advent of computers and satellites. </English>
